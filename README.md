# explorer

A public, server-rendered block explorer for the XRP Ledger and Xahau, on Cloudflare Workers. Loaders call the
GateHub Data API and the network's own node; nothing in the browser talks to either.

The design is in [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-explorer-foundation-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-explorer-foundation-design.md),
the implementation plan next to it in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Stack

| | Version when scaffolded |
|---|---|
| React Router (framework mode, server-rendered) | **8.4.0** (`react-router`, `@react-router/dev`) |
| React | 19.3.1 |
| Vite / `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` / Wrangler | 8.3.4 / 1.64.0 / 4.151.1 |
| Vitest / `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` | 5.0.5 / 1.4.4 |
| Node / pnpm | 24 / 10.6.3 |

The project came from `pnpm create cloudflare@latest --framework=react-router`, which is the Cloudflare route for
React Router 8: the upstream `create-react-router` default template plus Cloudflare's overlay. (The `cloudflare`
template of `remix-run/react-router-templates` the plan names no longer exists on that repository's main branch;
its `v7` branch is React Router 7.) Tailwind, the Dockerfile and the Google Fonts links of the template were
removed: the design system is hand-written CSS and the fonts are self-hosted.

`@react-router/cloudflare` is not installed. React Router 8 on the Cloudflare Vite plugin does not need it.

## Getting started

```sh
pnpm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars      # DATA_API_KEY and SENTRY_DSN; never commit .dev.vars
pnpm dev                            # http://localhost:5173
```

The data API hosts in `wrangler.jsonc` are placeholders that never resolve (`*.example.invalid`) until the hosts
are decided. To develop against a running data API, put its address in `.dev.vars` (`XRPL_DATA_API_URL=...`);
values there replace the `vars` of `wrangler.jsonc` locally.

## Scripts

| Script | |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Dev server, with the Worker running in workerd |
| `pnpm build` | Production build into `build/` |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `wrangler types` (runtime types into the git-ignored `worker-configuration.d.ts`), `react-router typegen`, `tsc -b` |
| `pnpm test` | `vitest run`: the `unit` project (Node) and the `worker` project (Workers runtime) |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright (set up in a later task) |
| `pnpm api:sync` | Copy the data API's OpenAPI document (`$DATA_API_REPO/docs/openapi.yaml`, default `../data-api-new`) to `api/openapi.yaml` and regenerate `app/server/openapi.d.ts`; name the source commit it prints in the commit message |
| `pnpm api:check` | Regenerate the types from the committed `api/openapi.yaml` and fail if `app/server/openapi.d.ts` differs (needs no `data-api-new`) |
| `pnpm deploy:staging`, `pnpm deploy:production` | Build for that Cloudflare environment, then `wrangler deploy` |
| `pnpm verify` | `api:check`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build` |

Run one project or one file with `pnpm test --project worker` or `pnpm test app/server`. Do not put `--` after
`pnpm test`: pnpm hands it to Vitest, which then treats everything after it as literal arguments and runs
everything. `--project unit` alone ends with a 10 s wait and a "close timed out" notice, because the React Router
plugin of the other project keeps a file watcher open; a path filter does not.

## Configuration

`app/server/env.ts` is the type of the Worker's bindings (`Env`) and the one place that knows how React Router 8
hands them to loaders: `workers/app.ts` creates the load context with `createLoadContext(env, ctx)`, and loaders
read it with `getEnv(context)` and `getExecutionContext(context)`.

| Name | Kind | Where it is set |
|---|---|---|
| `XRPL_DATA_API_URL`, `XAHAU_DATA_API_URL` | var | `wrangler.jsonc`, per environment (placeholders for now) |
| `XRPL_NODE_URL`, `XAHAU_NODE_URL` | var | `wrangler.jsonc`, per environment (`https://s1.ripple.com:51234/`, `https://xahau.network/`) |
| `VISITOR_LIMITER` | `ratelimits` binding, 60 per 10 s | `wrangler.jsonc`, per environment (own namespace each) |
| `DATA_API_KEY` | secret | `.dev.vars` locally; on the deployed Workers `x-explorer-staging` and `x-explorer-production` as a secret |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | secret, optional | the same |
| `BUILD_ID` | var | added to every build by `vite.config.ts` (`scripts/build-id.ts`): the short git commit, plus `-dirty` when the tree has uncommitted changes. `BUILD_ID=... pnpm build` overrides it. Without git it is `dev`, but a build for a Cloudflare environment (`CLOUDFLARE_ENV`, so every deploy) fails instead, because the edge cache key includes it |

The Cloudflare Vite plugin flattens one Cloudflare environment into the build, chosen at build time with
`CLOUDFLARE_ENV` (`pnpm deploy:staging` and `pnpm deploy:production` set it). `vars` and `ratelimits` are not
inherited, so each environment repeats them. The top level of `wrangler.jsonc` is local development and the tests.

## The data API and the node

`app/server/` is Worker-only code that loaders call; the browser never imports it.

| File | |
|---|---|
| `networks.ts` | `xrpl` and `xahau`: name, native currency, CTID network id, and the data API and node URLs from `Env`. The only place that knows a network's URLs. |
| `data-api.ts`, `api-types.ts` | `createDataApi(net, env, cache)`: typed `/v2` calls with the `X-API-Key` header, a 5 s limit and no redirects. The answers' types are written by hand from the data API's `docs/api-reference.md`, because `api/openapi.yaml` has parameters but no response schemas. The endpoint paths are checked against the generated `openapi.d.ts`, so a path that leaves the API fails `pnpm typecheck`. |
| `node-rpc.ts` | `createNodeRpc(net, cache)`: JSON-RPC to rippled or xahaud (`tx`, `ledger`, `account_info`, `account_objects`, `server_state`), 3 s limit. Times the node counts from 2000-01-01 are returned as unix seconds. |
| `upstream.ts` | `UpstreamError` (`not_found`, `bad_request`, `rate_limited`, `server`, `timeout`, `network`; `status`, `retryAfter`) and the deadline both clients use. |
| `cache-class.ts` | The five cache classes with their TTLs and `Cache-Control` values, and the `SubrequestCache` interface both clients take. |

## Tests

- `unit` project: `app/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`, `scripts/**/*.test.ts` and `test/unit/**/*.test.ts`, in Node. (`test/unit` is
  typechecked with `scripts/` by `tsconfig.node.json`, which has the Node types; `tsconfig.cloudflare.json` leaves it out.)
- `worker` project: `test/worker/**/*.spec.ts`, in workerd on the real Worker (`workers/app.ts`, the React Router
  plugin and `wrangler.jsonc`; the vars, secrets and `BUILD_ID` are pinned in `vitest.config.ts`, so a developer's
  `.dev.vars` does not reach the tests; the `VISITOR_LIMITER` binding comes from `wrangler.jsonc`). Call
  the Worker with `exports.default.fetch(...)` and read bindings with `env`, both from `cloudflare:workers`. (`SELF`
  and `cloudflare:test`'s `env` still exist but are deprecated.)
- Recorded mainnet ledgers (XRPL, XRPL AMM cases, Xahau), copied from `data-api-new` and kept as `.json.gz`, are in
  `test/fixtures/ledgers/`; `test/fixtures/PROVENANCE.md` says where each directory came from. Tests read them with
  `loadTx(set, hash)` and `allTxs(set)` from `test/support/ledgers.ts` (Node `fs`, test-only; `tsconfig.cloudflare.json`
  has no `node` types on purpose, so `test/support/node-modules.d.ts` declares the two modules that file uses).
- Recorded transaction metadata for the runtime check is in `test/fixtures/runtime/`: the AMMDeposit
  `83F332E0141EF2AD30427A8476FFD8469D678321F58E649F30761A862D880A4B` of ledger 107671558, from
  `data-api-new/packages/shared/test/fixtures/xrpl/recorded/107671558.json.gz`.

`@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` is the renamed `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` (that package is deprecated and its
last release, 0.23.0, only accepts Vitest 4). The API and configuration are the same.

## The parsing libraries in the Workers runtime

`test/worker/runtime.spec.ts` runs `ripple-lib-transactionparser` 0.8.2, `ripple-address-codec` 5 and
`bignumber.js` in workerd. All three load and give the right answers, so `app/domain/parse/` can use
`ripple-lib-transactionparser` (spec 1.1). The same calls, bundled by `react-router build` and run with
`vite preview`, returned the same balance changes as Node did for that AMMDeposit.

One thing the test setup needs: `ripple-address-codec` is CommonJS and `require()`s `@scure/base`, an ES module,
which Vitest's module runner in workerd cannot do (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'base58xrp')`).
`vitest.config.ts` therefore lists it under `deps.optimizer.ssr`, so Vite pre-bundles it for the `worker` project,
as the production build bundles it. Any new CommonJS dependency that fails to load in a `worker` test the same way
goes in that list. `ripple-lib-transactionparser` cannot go in it: it `require`s Node's `assert`, which the
optimizer does not resolve, and it loads without it.

## Deploying

Not automated yet (no CI in this repository). A deploy is `pnpm deploy:staging` or `pnpm deploy:production`, with
the real data API hosts in `wrangler.jsonc` and `DATA_API_KEY` set as a secret on the Worker (`x-explorer-staging`,
`x-explorer-production`).
